### Problem Statement
Development teams struggle with:
- Time-consuming manual project planning and task breakdown (hours → days for complex projects)
- Difficulty maintaining plan-code alignment throughout development lifecycle
- Lack of visibility into task dependencies and bottlenecks across large projects
- Inefficient context switching between planning tools and IDE (>20% productivity loss)
- Inconsistent task verification leading to quality issues and rework (15-30% of tasks)
- Manual GitHub Issues management causing sync drift and duplicate entry

### Solution
COE provides a unified, AI-powered platform that:
1. **Captures requirements** through an interactive 10-question design workflow
2. **Decomposes tasks** automatically using AI with dependency detection and critical path analysis
3. **Maps dependencies** with visual DAG rendering and circular dependency prevention
4. **Coordinates execution** via 4 specialized agent teams:
   - **Programming Orchestrator**: Master coordinator managing agent lifecycle and task routing
   - **Planning Team**: Generates project plans, roadmaps, and dependency-aware task breakdowns
   - **Answer Team**: Provides context-aware Q&A using plan + codebase with source citations
   - **Verification Team**: Automated testing + visual verification with user Ready gates
5. **Ensures quality** through smart checklists, design system integration, and automated investigation tasks
6. **Syncs with GitHub** for seamless bi-directional Issue sync (5-minute interval, rate-limit optimized)

> **🔍 Deep Dive**: For complete agent specifications, routing algorithms, and YAML profiles, see `Docs/Plans/COE-Master-Plan/02-Agent-Role-Definitions.md`

### Key Differentiators

> **📖 Implementation Guide**: See `CONSOLIDATED-MASTER-PLAN.md` Section 9 for complete Interactive Design Phase specifications

#### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration System (4 Specialized Teams)
Four specialized agent teams working in coordination via MCP (Model Context Protocol):

**Programming Orchestrator (Master Coordinator)**
- Routes tasks to appropriate agent based on task type and status
- Monitors agent health and performance metrics (response time, failure rate, velocity)
- Implements fallback strategies when agents fail (30-second timeout)
- Aggregates metrics for dashboard display with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Routing Algorithm**: 
  - `estimatedHours > 1` → Task Decomposition
  - `status = 'done'` → Verification
  - `requiresContext OR hasOpenQuestions` → Answer Team
  - Default → Planning Team

**Planning Team Agent**  
- Generates project plans from requirements using natural language processing
- Creates dependency-aware task breakdowns with DAG validation
- Estimates effort and timelines based on historical data and complexity analysis
- Adapts plans based on execution feedback and progress metrics
- **Output**: plan.json (tasks + dependencies), metadata.json (versioning), design-system.json references

**Answer Team Agent**  
- Provides context-aware Q&A using plan + codebase (semantic search)
- Answers technical questions accurately with confidence scoring (threshold: 0.7)
- Cites sources from plan sections, code files, and architecture docs
- Escalates complex questions to humans when confidence < 0.7
- **Context Sources**: Plan files, codebase, architecture docs, previous Q&A history

**Task Decomposition Agent**
- Detects complex tasks (estimated hours > 1 or flagged by Planning Team)
- Automatically generates 3-5 subtasks with AI assistance
- Preserves parent-child relationships and maintains dependency graph integrity
- Notifies user of decomposition with summary and impact analysis
- **Triggers**: >60-minute tasks, manual requests, complexity flags

**Verification Team Agent**
- Runs automated tests on task completion (unit, integration, E2E)
- Launches visual verification for UI changes with design system references
- Waits for user Ready signal before marking task complete
- Creates investigation tasks automatically on test failures or visual issues
- **Workflows**: 
  - Automated (backend tasks): Run tests → Pass/Fail → Report
  - Visual (UI tasks): Launch server → Display checklist → User verify → Report
  - Combined: Auto tests first, then visual verification if UI task

> **🤖 Complete Agent Specs**: See `Docs/Plans/COE-Master-Plan/02-Agent-Role-Definitions.md` for:
> - Complete agent profiles (1,021 lines)

# Enhancement: Implement background agent delegation system

**Type**: Enhancement
**Priority**: Medium
**Area**: Architecture

## Description
Implement a background agent delegation system to handle long-running tasks asynchronously.

## User Story
As a unified agent, I want to delegate time-consuming tasks to background agents so that I can continue orchestrating other work without blocking.

## Proposed Architecture
1. **Task Queue** - Queue for background work items
2. **Background Worker**

| R004 | Circular dependency detection algorithm fails on edge cases | Medium | Low | Implement comprehensive graph algorithm testing with 20+ edge cases. Use proven DAG validation libraries. | Mitigated - tests passing |
| R005 | MCP API contract misalignment between server and extension | High | Low | Define OpenAPI spec for MCP tools. Automated integration tests. Version MCP protocol. | Mitigated - contract documented |
| R006 | Performance degradation with large task graphs (>1000 tasks) | Low | Medium | Implement lazy loading for large graphs. Virtual scrolling for task lists. Benchmark with 5000+ task graphs. | Planned for Phase 4 |

## Assumptions

- Team has access to GitHub Copilot licenses
- VS Code Extension API remains stable (no breaking changes)
- GitHub API rate limits are sufficient for development needs
- SQLite is acceptable for MVP (no need for distributed DB)
- Design system JSON schema is finalized before UI implementation
- Team members available full-time for project duration
- No major feature changes during implementation phase

---

## Constraints

- Must use VS Code Extension API (no standalone app)
- MVP launch by February 15, 2026 (hard deadline)
- Budget limited to development time only (no external services)
- GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour)
- VS Code webview limitations for UI complexity
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing plans
- No breaking changes to MCP protocol during development

---

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Multi-user collaboration (real-time editing)
- Cloud storage/sync (local files only for MVP)
- Mobile app or web interface
- Integration with Jira, Asana, or other PM tools
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards
- Multi-language support (English only for MVP)
- Custom AI model training (using existing Copilot)
- Enterprise SSO and advanced security features
