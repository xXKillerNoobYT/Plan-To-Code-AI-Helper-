# Please fix the target spec block to increase the line coverage or fix the test code.
# Guidelines:
- If no need to update, please return `NO_NEED_TO_CHANGE` in a code block.
- Keep the existing JS Doc before the test case if any.
- DO NOT change anything outside the target spec block, if you do the the spec file will be invalid.
# Return the new spec block in the code block.
